# Marvel Movies and Series
I like Marvel movies and series because each movies and series are connected to each other.
All of the movies and series are set to only one universe which means that crossovers exists.
I love to see superheroes interact with others, as well as their villains.

Here's my top 3 movies and series in Phase 4:
<br />
Movies:
1. Spider-Man: No Way Home
2. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings
3. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness

Series:
1. Loki
2. WandaVision
3. Moon Knight
